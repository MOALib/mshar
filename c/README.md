# MShar

ANSI C Implementation of MShar, under 10k of lines of ANSI C code with realloc and strcat spams.

Link with libm if used with C90 (custom snprintf integer functions) although in reality, you don't need to as we do not use integers.

## CMake Integration

TBA

## Bindings

Python and C# bindings exist, look at the `binding` directory.
