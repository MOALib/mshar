    A better shell archiver that needs base64 to run lmao

    It will output a shell script that will extract itself.

    Can self update itself (if you have git and the place where it is located is actually a git repository)

    Includes an api that you can use, to use it, 
    use the command "source /path/to/mshar noop" to silence output, then use the mkmshar api. 

    mkshar api: mkshar /path/to/archive /your/wanted/files /princess/peach/pics /nuclear/missle/codes

    Shdoc has better documentation than this man page, get it at https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc

    To modify mshar, just modify the mshar script, it's a shell script.

    All you need to know are shell script knowledge.

    TBH, you need base64 to run this thing and extract archives created with it.
